                    Good quality mammography positioning is critical in supporting correct diagnosis.
                    Itâ€™s important that as much breast tissue as possible is included on the image and that it is optimally displayed.
                    Imaging all the breast tissue in a consistent and reproducible way assists the radiologist to review the whole breast and compare images, improving diagnostic outcomes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ImagED-Mammography allows the User to assess a range of measures that evaluate the quality of the positioning of a mammogram.
                    These measures are based on the PGMI (perfect, good, moderate, inadequate) positioning guidelines used by the NHSBSP and BreastScreen Australia.
                    Assessing positioning quality is difficult, as is the positioning itself, and is recognised as being in part subjective.
                    However ImagED-Mammography enables the User to better recognise positioning errors and improve image quality.

                    You can estimate the relative position of the nipple visually or, using the length tool,
                    you can measure the width of the breast and the distance to the nipple, so as to estimate if the nipple is centrally positioned in the breast.
                </p>
                <p>Similarly you can measure the vertical size of the image and the distance to the nipple, so as to estimate if the nipple is centrally positioned on the image.</p>
